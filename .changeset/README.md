# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to Use Changesets in EvoDB

### Creating a Changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Viewing Pending Changes

To see what changesets are waiting to be released:

```bash
pnpm changeset status
```

### Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. When changesets are merged to `main`:

1. A "Version Packages" PR is created automatically
2. Merging that PR triggers npm publishing
3. Git tags are created for the release

For more details, see [docs/PUBLISHING.md](../docs/PUBLISHING.md).
